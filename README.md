I'm happy to share with you my simple desktop application using Python 3 as a language and using  Tkinter as a library
it's a simple application that allows the user to digitize and control their sales operations by entering some information
Users have the ability to manage everything through this application
Like : 
The list of products that go up and remain in stock
Sales and invoice history
print an invoice or download as a pdf file
This is my GitHub application: https://github.com/kefimaher/Gstock
